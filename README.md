# Global Terrorism Database EDA

 # Overview

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database. The dataset used in this analysis is `globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv`. The main goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the dataset by performing comprehensive EDA. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) from 1970 to 2017. It contains detailed information about terrorist incidents worldwide, including but not limited to:

- Date and time of the incident.
- Location (country, region, city).
- Attack type.
- Target type.
- Perpetrator group.
- Number of casualties.
- Attack motive.

You can download the dataset from the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.
- **Global Terrorism Database EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and analysis.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process involves a variety of data visualization and statistical techniques to gain insights from the dataset. In the Jupyter Notebook (`Global Terrorism Database EDA.ipynb`), you will find the following sections:

1. Data Loading: Loading and initial exploration of the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data types, and outliers.
3. Data Visualization: Creating plots and charts to visualize trends and patterns.
4. Statistical Analysis: Using statistical tests to derive meaningful conclusions.
5. Key Findings: Summarizing the most important insights from the analysis.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

To reproduce the EDA and explore the dataset yourself, follow these steps:

1. Download the `globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv` dataset from the GTD website.
2. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook (`Global Terrorism Database EDA.ipynb`) to your local environment.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook, making sure to adjust file paths as necessary.

## Results

The results of this EDA project will provide a better understanding of the patterns and trends within the Global Terrorism Database. The key findings will help identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and possibly reveal factors contributing to terrorist activities.
